# Dallas PD Crime Tracker

Dallas PD Crime Tracker (w/ Feed Trigger) based on Dallas Open Data API. Built on Python.
Script is meant to be used as a cron job. 

## Why?
This was created to track (be on the loop with) incidents/police active calls within a desired area

## How to run?
Script is incomplete. You have to create function that does something with the data once it is fetched. A good example would be to link it to Pushbullet API, IFTTT API, Google Sheets API on given certain criteria. 

## Requirements:
* Python
* Requests (pip install requests)


## //TODO 
* Geo-fencing is a possibility in the future.
